       ">         * Implications:  The vague wording might make it difficult to prove a breach.  The 5-year term is relatively standard but could be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the information.\n",
       "> \n",
       ">     - Exclusions:\n",
       ">         * Purpose: To carve out exceptions to the confidentiality obligations, preventing the NDA from being overly restrictive.\n",

       "> This NDA is a relatively standard agreement, but the broad definition of \"Confidential Information\" and the vague wording regarding the Recipient's obligations create potential ambiguity. It would be advisable for both parties to clarify these points before signing.  The Recipient should consider requesting more specific examples of what constitutes Confidential Information and clearer guidance on the practical steps required to maintain \"strictest confidence.\"  The Discloser should consider refining the definition to avoid overreach and potential future disagreements.  Legal review is recommended for both parties, especially the Recipient, before signing.\n"
